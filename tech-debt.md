#### This is the list of technical debts I've seen so far

- Need to refactor the actions and reducers to be organized by component
- raise the test coverage
- using a combineReducer to create a rootReducer on the index.js component
- create a carousel in the details page
- make the cars selected on the shop cart unavailable
- add the number of selected products
- create the environments on the react project to allow running it on local and docker
- dockerize the frontend and add it to docker-compose
- Frank's should not steal the Aston Martin logo and do their own.
